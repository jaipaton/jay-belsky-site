        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this volume, Jay Belsky, Avshalom Caspi, Terrie Moffitt and Richie Poulton share what they
          have learned about childhood, adolescence, and adulthood; about genes and parenting, and about
          vulnerability, resilience, and success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidence drawn from three major longitudinal studies, two in the UK and one in the USA, makes
          clear that human development is not subject to ironclad, deterministic laws but instead is a
          matter of possibilities and probabilities—multiple forces that together shape the direction a
          life will take.
        </p>
        <p>
          A child’s early years do predict who they will become later in life, but they do so imperfectly.
          For example, genes and trouble families play a combined role in both violent male behavior and
          mid-life health while childhood adversity and severe bullying in adolescence can affect even
          physical well-being decades after the teen years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Painstaking and revelatory, the discoveries emanating from these major investigations as
          presented in The Origins of You, holds promise to help schools, parents, and all people who seek
          to foster well-being and ameliorate or prevent developmental problems.
        </p>

            “The Origins of You brings the groundbreaking research of the top developmental psychologists
            of the past quarter-century to a wider audience. The book captures the genius and visionary
            stature of its authors and illustrates their profound influence on the current and future
            thinking in the field. A masterpiece!”

            “It's hard to imagine a better introduction to the way that contemporary developmental
            scientists think than The Origins of You, and it is hard to think of a more qualified group of
            writers, themselves among the most important, creative, and accomplished scholars in the
            field, to serve as guides. In much the same way that Bronfenbrenner's The Ecology of Human
            Development forever changed the way we think about the environment, this book will change the
            way we think about the process of development itself. The Origins of You is destined to become
            a classic”
