        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Nature of Nurture challenges prevailing views of how children’s early-life experience shape
          their future development, as these treat so-called normal development (e.g., secure, autonomous,
          cooperative, friendly, stable intimate relations, supportive parenting) as how nature intended
          humans to develop and deviations from such “optimal” development as reflective of dysfunction,
          dysregulation and disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
          What remains underappreciated is that early-life adversity has not been uncommon in our species’
          history and, as a result, evolution has shaped how children respond in ways that increase, or at
          least once did, their chances of passing on their genes to future generations, the ultimate goal
          of all living things: to make more life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nature of Nurture thus shares developmental insights that emerge when one puts on
          evolutionary lenses to look at effects of nurture in childhood, ones that have not been
          considered by traditional discussions of nature and nurture.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first part of the book, author Belsky reveals why and how adversity accelerates
          development, perhaps most notably resulting in earlier sexual development than would otherwise
          have occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the second half of the book, he makes clear that such effects do not emerge in all
          children, because evolution has also shaped families to bear offspring who vary in their
          developmental plasticity, with some being more and others less susceptible to environmental
          influences, including parenting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final chapter, implications and applications of evolutionary-developmental understanding
          are highlighted, making clear that in some cases they have much in common with more traditional
          thinking, but in other ways offer new insights.

          <blockquote>
            “The Nature of Nurture brilliantly unravels the mysteries of why and how early adversity
            matters—not just psychologically, but biologically. In doing so, Jay Belsky deftly
            dismantles the age-old nature-nurture dichotomy. This provocative book reshapes our
            understanding of what it means to be resilient or at-risk, making it indispensable reading
            for policymakers, educators, and parents alike.”

            “The Nature of Nurture is the modern synthesis that developmental science has sorely needed
            for decades. I guarantee that Jay Belsky’s highly readable book will radically transform the
            way you think about how genetic and environmental factors interact to shape the course of
            human development.”

            “In these pages, a world expert on child development sets out to trace his own development as
            he gradually integrates evolutionary perspectives into a lifelong quest to understand ‘how,
            why, and for whom’ childhood circumstances shape later life. The Nature of Nurture is as
            important for its insider’s view of paradigm shifts currently underway across the social
            sciences as it is for Jay Belsky’s revelatory insights into human psychology and reproductive
            strategies.”

            “In a lucid and comprehensive rendition of a complex field, Jay Belsky provides an elegant
            summary of how individual susceptibilities and variations in early environmental conditions
            conjointly bend human development toward its broad diversity of outcomes. The Nature of
            Nurture offers both scientists and lay readers nothing short of the erudition and clarity of
            thought we have come to expect from a first-rate scholar of evolutionary principles in
            developmental psychology.”
